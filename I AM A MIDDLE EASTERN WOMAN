### I AM A MIDDLE EASTERN WOMAN
Life has been so harsh on me
my body does not belong to me
my ideas are not important
my freedom is non existing 
I am just a tool for others rule
my voice is too weak 
how can life be soo cruel?
I guess I have to play it cool
because of the damn rules 
I will walk with my head down 
because i've stepped down
I have no more energy to fight 
as all the light has faded away
