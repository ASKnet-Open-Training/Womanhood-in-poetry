I am a woman of many talents, 
and the guardian of my
     children.
I have the strength of my God,
to lead me through whatever 
Life has in store for me.
I shall look ahead, rather than 
be pulled back to past sorrows 
or mistakes, for only by moving 
forward can I begin anew. I will 
pray for those I love, that my 
love may be their blessings, 
that my prayers will be their 
strength.
I will love myself, because my 
Father in heaven loves me even 
more.
I will sleep peaceful, knowing I 
have done my best, and no 
longer burden myself with 
thoughts of unworthiness, or 
worry about what other people 
think...because all that matters 
is my family.
