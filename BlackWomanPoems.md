# THE BLACK WOMAN POEMS.


**THE BLACK WOMAN**

   *Piece no.1*

She is tall like a Cypress
Strong beyond all definition 
Thus edging into life from the back door
She is the Black Woman
With Skin
like sleeping in on snow days
beneath thick blankets black.

Despite the million things that hurt her, she speaks of nothing. 
Nothing but happiness.
Alone, by herself she builds the kingdom that she wants
The kingdom of a happy family ,
She is the Black Woman.

The world man-handles her,
The ungrateful men damage her 
Her damaged petals are what made her more beautiful than all the other flowers.
Because she is a survivor
The root to every family that stands unity.

She is a beautiful piece of broken pottery, put back together by her own hands. 
And a critical world judges her cracks while missing the beauty of how she made herself whole again for firmity of her own  kind "M.E.N"
She is the Black Woman.

She is full of wounds riddled with scars, but she is still standing and she is still beautiful.
And just like the moon she is, so lonely, so full of imperfections.
But just like the moon, she shines in times of darkness when lightened.

She is water. 
Soft enough to offer life, 
and yet tough enough to drown it away.
Her backs tell stories no books have the spine to carry.
The bravest thing she ever did was to stay alive each day to realise herself as
"THE BLACK WOMAN".

Donâ€™t underestimate HER. SHE knows more than SHE says, thinks more than SHE speaks, notices more than you realize.
She fights through some bad days to earn the best days of her life.
SHE IS THE BLACK WOMAN..
